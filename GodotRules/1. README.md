GodotRules
==========

>   A Rule System implementation for Godot, written in C++ and GDScript.

This module stands on the shoulders of CLIPS v.6.31 expert system shell, the
RETE algorithm implementation developed by NASA.

>   RETE is widely considered to be the fastest pattern-matching algorithm in the world and is used by many popular production RSs, including Tibco Business Events, Newgen OmniRules, CLIPS, Jess, Drools, IBM Operational Decision Management, OPSJ, Blaze Advisor, BizTalk Rules Engine, Soar, Clara and Sparkling Logic SMARTS.

Design principles
=================

-   Rest upon Godot's design philosophy

-   Easily embeddable into existing project

-   Separation of Logic and Data

-   Human readable Rules

-   Reasoning over objects

-   To be reasonably fast, reasonably compact, and easily scalable

-   Unfussy debugging

-   Close to natural language as far as possible

-   Tight integration with common tooling (CLIPS-lang extension for: Atom,
    VScode etc. )
