Examples
============
Easy example pulled out from the **Age of Empires 2** ruleset:
```
(defrule build-lumber-camp
    (resource-found wood) 
    (building-type-count-total lumber-camp < 5)
    (dropsite-min-distance wood > 5)
    (can-build lumber-camp)
=>
(build lumber-camp))
```

Here's a bit more complicated, Godot-tailored, object-oriented piece of ruleset from our *deck-building card game* project:
```
(defrule on_card_just_played_vengeful_spirit

    (object (is-a Card) 
    (id vengeful_spirit)
	(name ?card)
	(state JUST_PLAYED))

    (object (is-a Game) 
	(current_player ?player)
    (enemies $?enemies))

    (object (is-a CardPlayer)
	(name ?player)
	(weapon ?weapon))
=> 
	(now ?card set state PLAYED)
	(pin_text "You have chosen Vengeful spirit")
    	(bind old_atck_range (now ?player get attack_range))
    	(. ?player set attack_range (+ old_atck_range 2))
    	(foreach ?enemy ?enemies
        	(bind old_def (now ?enemy get defence_factor))	
		(.. 
        	-> ?enemy set defence_factor (- old_def 5)
        	-> ?player attack ?enemy ?weapon))
    	(to_next_player)
    )
```
