CLIPS Expert System module for Godot
====================================

A C++ module for rule based game development in Godot Engine.

### Is part of GodotRules project

To make game development in Godot even easier we have packaged well-known
[CLIPS](http://www.clipsrules.net/) (expert system shell and rule-engine
developed in NASA) as a Godot module.

It unlocks the enormous potential of rapid gamed design and development for all
platforms.

It is distributed as a
[GDExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension.html)

include the generated binary in your project to use the extension.
